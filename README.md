# censusmerge

Simple tool for merging two Lua Tables created by Lexie's [CensusPlusTurtle](https://github.com/Lexiebean/CensusPlusTurtle)

`npm install`, put "CensusPlusTurtle.lua" and "CensusPlusTurtle1.lua" in the folder and run `node makejson.js`

You can find a fork of [turtle-census](https://github.com/gwetchen/turtle-census) that reads the resulting json file [here](https://github.com/gwetchen/turtle-census/tree/censusjson).
